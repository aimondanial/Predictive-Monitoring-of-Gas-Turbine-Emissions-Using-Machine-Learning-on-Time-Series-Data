•	Developed a predictive model to monitor and control carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in a power plant gas turbine generating approximately 200 MWh, ensuring compliance with environmental policies.
•	Utilized data from over 360 sensors positioned at the gas turbine, with one-minute interval samples over a month, resulting in nearly 40,000 instances. Sensors measured ambient conditions, compression efficiency, fuel combustion dynamics, turbine performance, and exhaust emissions.
•	Applied machine learning technique, including ensemble method and deep learning to build a regression model predicting CO and NOx emissions based on sensor data.
•	Achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.16, demonstrating high accuracy in emissions prediction.
